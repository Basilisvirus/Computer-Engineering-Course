; Lab number: 2
; Title: Task 4
;
; Hardware: STK600, CPU ATmega2560
;
; Function: a general delay routine that can be called from other programs. It should be named ;wait_milliseconds. The number of milliseconds should be transferred to register pair R24, R25.
;
;; Output ports: on-board LEDs connected to PORTB.
